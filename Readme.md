# **Summary**
<font size=5>Calculator is very written in ***very basic JavaScript***. This application has mostly used ***If-else conditional statement, arrow function, forEach and have used addEventListener*** as well. By using the above concepts, have helped me ***understanding*** more in those areas.

***Future Improvements:*** Show the 1+1+....on screen altogether and work on Memory buttons as well</font>
